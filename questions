It's the job of any decent developer to ask questions before jumping in to code. There are a number
that are unanswered for this.

1.) The example file is given one word per line. Is this the only input format to be handled?
2.) From wikipedia "An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase"
However the specs define it as such "(just a reminder: an anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to form a new word)"
This would restrict mulit-word candidate anagrams.
3.) The input is given to be "empires" should be be able to support arbitrary inputs?
4.) Does intermediate punctuation invalidate an anagram?

I've gone ahead and created this program assuming:

1.) Yes
2.) wikipedia definition, however the inputs will restrict candidate return values
3.) Yes
4.) No
